# Feasibility Study

- **Technical Feasibility**: Hardware (ESP32, sensors, valves) is cheap & available; software (Arduino IDE, Python, TensorFlow) is open-source.  
- **Cost Feasibility**: Prototype cost ≈ ₹5,000–₹8,000, affordable compared to water savings.  
- **Operational Feasibility**: Easy to set up and maintain; IoT dashboard simplifies use.  
- **Scalability**: Modular design supports expansion to large farms.
