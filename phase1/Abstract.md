# Abstract

This project proposes an intelligent irrigation system using AI and IoT to automate water release in a micro-irrigation setup. Soil moisture sensors send real-time data to an ESP32 microcontroller, which integrates with a machine learning model to predict irrigation requirements. The system controls solenoid valves accordingly and provides real-time monitoring via an IoT dashboard.  

Expected outcomes include reduced water wastage, optimized crop growth, and sustainable farming practices.
