# Literature Survey

## Existing Work
1. IoT-based irrigation systems reduce manual work but mostly use threshold rules.  
2. Timer-based irrigation often wastes water by ignoring soil conditions.  
3. AI in agriculture is used for yield prediction and pest detection, but limited use for predictive irrigation.  

## Research Gap
Few systems combine IoT with AI/ML for predictive and automated irrigation in micro-irrigation setups.
