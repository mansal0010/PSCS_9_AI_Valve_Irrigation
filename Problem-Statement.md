# Problem Statement

Traditional irrigation systems waste water because they are time-based or manual and do not consider real-time soil moisture conditions. Over-irrigation leads to waterlogging and nutrient loss, while under-irrigation stresses crops and reduces yields.  

This project aims to solve these issues by creating an AI + IoT system that automatically regulates irrigation valves in a micro-irrigation network based on soil moisture data.
