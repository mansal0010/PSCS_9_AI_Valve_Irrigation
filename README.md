# PSCS_9_AI_Valve_Irrigation
🌱 Project Overview: PSCS_9
Title: Automatic regulation of valves for release of water based upon soil moisture availability in the root zone of the crop, using artificial intelligence, in a piped and micro irrigation network of irrigation system

🔍 In Brief:
This project aims to automate irrigation by using AI-driven control systems that monitor soil moisture levels in the root zone of crops. Based on real-time data, it regulates valves in a piped micro-irrigation network to release water only when needed, optimizing water usage and improving crop health.

⚙️ Key Features
- 🌡️ Soil Moisture Sensing: Sensors placed in the root zone detect real-time moisture levels.
- 🧠 AI-Based Decision Making: AI algorithms analyze moisture data, crop type, weather forecasts, and soil characteristics to decide when and how much water to release.
- 🚰 Automated Valve Control: Valves are electronically controlled to release water precisely where and when it's needed.
- 📡 IoT Integration: Wireless communication between sensors, controllers, and central systems for remote monitoring and control.
- 📊 Data Logging & Analytics: Historical data is stored for performance analysis, predictive irrigation planning, and system optimization.
- 🔋 Energy Efficient: Can be powered by solar panels or low-energy systems for sustainability in rural areas.

🌾 Applications
- Precision Agriculture: Enhances water efficiency and crop yield by delivering water tailored to each plant's needs.
- Smart Farming Systems: Integrates with broader farm automation platforms for holistic resource management.
- Water-Scarce Regions: Ideal for areas with limited water availability, reducing wastage and improving sustainability.
- Greenhouses & Controlled Environments: Maintains optimal moisture levels for high-value crops.
- Government Irrigation Schemes: Can be scaled for large public irrigation networks to improve resource allocation.
